# OKFN_Data_Challenge_3
Project to scrap UK spending data

This is a Python project to scrap and spider dtat.gov.uk
run the scrape_data_gov_publishers.py program.

The output is to data_gov_publisher_results.csv

I'm a beginning Python programmer and had to learn the API, json, Git
and a few other "technical" tools.

This problem also justifies me dumping Windows for Lunix
